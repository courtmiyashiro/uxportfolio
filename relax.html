                    <br>
                    <p>RELAX is a meditation app that helps users better their mental health. It emphasizes the importance of mental health in our current world, sending a message that you are not alone. RELAX is a free, effective, and more personal app that allows users to express, track, and cope with their mental health that can be caused by various factors of life.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this project was to create an app that would be beneficial for every day mental health.</p>
                    
                    <p>I took the lead role on a team of three in researching and designing RELAX. </p>

                    <p>As an individual and student who has anxiety, mental health is a crucial part of my life that I am constantly trying to improve. Mental health tends to be seen as a touchy subject that isn't often focused on. We wanted to create an app that embraces mental health and assists individuals of all types in bettering their mental health.</p>

                    <p>It is recognized that the market for mental health awareness apps has begun to increase over the recent years; however, there have been evident user problems with these apps. With our user research, we strived to pinpoint issues with current mental health apps in order to make RELAX the most effective and user-friendly as possible. </p>

                    <p>Our goal was to create a calm, pleasant experience for the user and make it a positive resource to turn to.</p>

                    <p>As students, we felt that many people such as college students such as ourselves, adults, young and old, experience difficulties with handling and coping with their mentla health. The constant workload of classes, extra-curriculars, and jobs while trying to balance a social life is not easy. We acknowledged that all of this can result in stress, anxiety, and/or depression building up quickly, and many can find themeselves lost and frustrated with how to cope with it.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong class="important">Our Problem Statement:</strong></p>
                    <p>College students and adults need to be able to have a free, effective and more personal way to express, track, and cope with their mental health problems that can be caused by school, work, and personal life issues because it is important for those who struggle with their mental health to be able to have positive guidance without dealing with the stress of finding and affording good therapy or using ineffective subscription based apps that don't offer enough help.</p>

                   <p>This project allowed me to become familiar with using UX/collaboration platforms such as Miro and Adobe XD. I was able to go through the full process of forming a design plan, conducting research, and carrying out the development of a complete app. Because of this project, I was pushed to take a lead and learn on the go.</p>

                    <p>Key takeaways from this project are:</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Learning on the go is beneficial</strong> - Before this project, I had no experience using Adobe XD. With time and being hands-on with it, I was able to learn quickly. I was able to familiarize myself with how to use Adobe XD each and every time I worked to design the app. With limited time to create this app and an extensive amount of time using Adobe XD, learning on the go was very beneficial.  </li>
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Communication is critical</strong> - Even though I was only working with two other individuals, communication was still difficult at times. Sometimes we are not all on the same page, and at times, it takes a person to clearly communicate and take the leadership role. I learned to become comfortable speaking up about what tasks needed to be completed and what needed to be fixed.</li>
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Creating an app requires a lot of time and analyzing</strong> - During this project, I found myself creating and designing a majority of the app. I learned that I had to carefully analyze every component especially when wiring components to each other. I realized that I had to have an eye for watching out for errors or else the app would not be correct.</li>

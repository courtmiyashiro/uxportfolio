                    <p>During my final semester of college, I took a course focusing on user-centered research and usability testing.</p>

                    <p>The course consisted of a semester-long project which would focus specifically on approaches to counter fake news and misinformation on short-video sharing platforms.</p>

                    <p>I underwent the full UX research process which consisted of determining goals, exploring research questions, choosing appropriate methods, and conducting interviews and testing.</p>

                    <p>We are now living in an era where trust has been lost in institutions causing the increase of fake news on social media. Because of the increase in fake news and misinformation on popular platforms, tools and services are being advanced to help combat the spread.</p>
                    
                    <p>Although there have been efforts to combat the spread of fake news and misinformation, there is still limited research on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram.</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to find a solution to this problem, an understanding of users' behaviors, judgements, and attitudes toward misinformation countermeasures is essential. It is critical to gain insight into how users view misinformation content and why users promote it.</p>

                   <p>This semester-long study introduced me to what the full UX research process entails. As I progressed through each step of the process, I learned more of the do's and don'ts for collecting data and conducting surveys and interviews. </p>

                    <p>Key takeways from this study are:</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">User-centered research doesn't just include interviews</strong> - Before I took this specific course, I was not super familiar with the full process of conducting research. I generalized the process and knew it involved basic steps such as understanding the problem and conducting interviews. Because of this study, I learned that there is much more to the process such as finding current research on the problem and identifying the specific need for more research was important in order to progress.</li>
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Prepare for interviews thoroughly</strong> - I learned that the amount of preparation for conducting an interview had a direct effect on the success of the interview. Using an interview protocol, laying out all my questions, and having multiple ways of recording the interview helped tremendously. I was also able to become more comfortable with being the interviewer. </li>
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">User-centered research is fun with the right topic</strong> - Before undergoing this study, I was intimidated with how much time it was going to take and all the steps. However, even through the times I got a bit stressed, I found the research process worthwhile because the study was on a topic that was still current and something I could relate to.</li>

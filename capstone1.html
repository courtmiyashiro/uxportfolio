                    <p>A senior capstone project which was focused on throughout an entire semester. The project involved working with The Ole School Alumni Scholarship Group, a JMU alumni group who aims to connect students with mentors and internship, job, and scholarship opportunities. </p>

                     <p>The goal of this project was to apply all skills learned throughout the major and collaborate with CIS majors to develop a complete web system for the client.</p>

                    <p>My team placed within the Top 3 after Sprint #3 and overall Top 5 out of 12 teams after the final sprint.</p>

                    <p>I worked on an 11 person team consisting of nine Computer Information Systems majors and two Interactive Design majors including myself. Together, we were tasked with creating a system the Ole School Alumni Scholarship Group could use as an extension to their website. This system would be utilized by all members of the group to manage, edit, find scholarships, job, and internship opportunities as well as communicate. </p>

                    <p>Throughout the duration of the semester, my team and I attended several meetings with the client to understand their needs and current pain points.</p>

                    <p>The project was divided into 4 sprints, each sprint concluding with a presentation to the client and professors. Within each sprint, my team and I worked together to plan, design, and develop the system which would best serve the client. </p>

                    <li>Organizational information is disorganized</li>

                    <p>Along with the design we went with for the wireframes, I took the suggestions given by students from the survey as well as sites my team and I were familiar with into consideration. These sites included LinkedIn, Handshake, and SEO.</p>

                    <p>Throughout this project, I was able to get a feel for what it is like to work on a team consisting of members who have different skills and backgrounds. This project was eye-opening and allowed me to experience real-world scenarios that would come up in a real job. I was able to put all of my knowledge into this project and work toward a goal by communicating and taking the lead in multiple areas.</p>
                    
                    <p>Key takeways from this project are:</p>

                    <ul class="list">
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Listen to the client</strong> - Throughout this project, I learned from professors and experience with the client, that we have to listen to what the client wants. Regardless, if we disagree with their ideas or wants, we have to listen to them. However, we can still suggest our own design ideas to the client that could be beneficial.</li>
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Communication and planning is key</strong> - Earlier in the project, poor communication and planning made things even harder. I learned that if no one else was stepping up, then I had to be the one to push the team to communicate what progress was being made and initiate planning for team meetings.</li>
                        <li><strong class="takeaways">Set aside differences</strong> - This was the very first time I had worked on a team with 10 other individuals. I learned that everyone has different opinions and different personalities. Sometimes these differences created a hostile team environment; however, I learned that I need to respect the individual no matter what. We are all working toward the same goal and need to value each other.</li>
